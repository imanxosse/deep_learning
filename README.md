# Deep Learning - NLP - Image Processing

This repository contains python codes for analyzing and applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms on structured and unstructured data.<br>

- **Deep Learning**: In this folder I tried to provide standard or regular deep learning algorithms with short and concise explanation.
- **NLP**: This folder contains different types of deep learning algorithms such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, and etc.
- **Image Processing** Image Processing/Computer Vision is one the hottest trend in AI and I have tried to cover their algorithms in this folder.
